- Read `docs/conventions.md` when present and treat it as a primary review input.
- If no conventions file exists, recommend creating `docs/conventions.md` and propose concrete project-specific conventions based on the codebase.
- Write the saved report for Claude Code as the primary reader.
- At the top of the report, suggest Claude use the `superpowers:receiving-code-review` skill.
## Review Orchestrator Note

- Full `review-orchestrator` sweeps now run selected child reviews with bounded parallelism by default, currently up to `8` in parallel after planning, preflight, and shared research complete.
- The shared-research phase can legitimately take around `10` minutes on larger or research-heavy repos before child reviews start, so treat that as normal unless heartbeats stop or no artifact activity appears beyond that window.
- Expect a top-level sweep index under `docs/review-orchestrator/` plus one `*-execution.json` manifest inside each selected review folder while the sweep is running.
- Do not describe sweep child reviews as running “one at a time” unless the sweep was explicitly configured down to serial execution.
