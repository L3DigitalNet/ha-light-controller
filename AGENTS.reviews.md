## Review Rules

- Review implementation code by default, not the test suite in isolation, unless the user explicitly asks for a test review.
- Read `docs/handoff.md` and `docs/conventions.md` first and treat them as primary review inputs.
- Write saved reports for Claude and Codex as the primary readers.
- Suggest the receiving-code-review workflow at the top of a saved report when that recommendation is relevant.

## Review Orchestrator

- Full `review-orchestrator` sweeps run selected child reviews with bounded parallelism by default, currently up to `8` in parallel.
- Shared research can take around `10` minutes on larger or research-heavy repos before child reviews start.
- Expect a top-level sweep index under `docs/review-orchestrator/` plus one `*-execution.json` manifest inside each selected review folder while the sweep is running.
